Beijing Air Quality Data Analysis Project

	Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting air quality in Beijing based on a dataset containing over 420,000 records. The objective is to clean the data, perform classification and clustering analysis, visualize insights, predict air quality categories, and identify anomalies and hotspot regions. The project aims to explore air quality trends and influencing factors, providing scientific evidence to support environmental governance.

	Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers to ensure data quality.

Classification Analysis: Built models to predict air quality levels (Good, Moderate, Slight Pollution, etc.) based on historical data.

Clustering Analysis: Identified patterns and clustered different regions based on pollution concentrations.

Anomaly Detection: Recognized abnormal pollution events and highlighted hotspot regions.

Data Visualization: Presented findings through comprehensive charts and maps for clear interpretation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored factors affecting air quality changes and validated meaningful hypotheses.
